# 🌤️ A look at the last 50 years of temperature and precipitation data in Lanzarote.

Hey there! Welcome to this repository, part of a project where I use data from the Spanish [AEMET](https://www.aemet.es) to know more about temperature and precipitation trends in Lanzarote 
over the last 50 years. Using data collected at the island's airport, I start by exploring the annual mean temperature and its deviations from the period 1981-2010 (which I use as a 
reference). Then, I break it down a bit further, by looking at the average temperature by decade and zooming in at a monthly level.<br>
<br>
Next, it's time to turn into precipitation data. Drawing conclusions here can be tricky, as Lanzarote has scarce and highly irregular rainfall, which makes it a bit challenging to draw conclusions. Still, I examine yearly total precipitation recorded at the airport and how it compares with the reference period.<br>
<br>
Finally, I take a closer look at 2023 and 2024, exploring how daily temperatures deviated from the reference period, as well as monthly total precipitation.<br>
